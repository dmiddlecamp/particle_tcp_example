# particle_tcp_example

This code sample demonstrates sending data in bulk over TCP to a dedicated server.


# What this demo doesn't show

This demo is meant to be a quick primer, and doesn't demonstrate receiving messages on the device, 
or encryption and authentication for the device and data.  That's an exercise left for the reader for now, 
or something that can come in future versions.

Thanks!
